- You must have installed Shopify CLI version 3.45.1 or higher
- You must have ngrok installed to run the App on the local system

  - AppBridge
  - Polaris
  - Webhooks
  - Rest API

  - Theme App Extensions

## Tech Stack

This template combines a number of third party open-source tools:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for routing. We wrap this with file-based routing.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) queries the Admin API.

The following Shopify tools complement these third-party tools to ease app development:

- [Shopify API library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) adds OAuth to the Express backend. This lets users install the app and grant scope permissions.
- [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) adds authentication to API requests in the frontend and renders components outside of the Appâ€™s iFrame.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Custom hooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/tree/main/hooks) make authenticated requests to the Admin API.
- [File-based routing](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/blob/main/Routes.jsx) makes creating new pages easier.
